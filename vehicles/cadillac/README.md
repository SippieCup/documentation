GM and Cadillac (specifically with the CT6 as of July 2018) have a great offering known as SuperCruise which offers similar functionality as openpilot built-in to the vehicles.

It's definitely the most sophisticated we've seen to date, but the team at Comma.ai, Inc. plans to match this quality if not exceed it by the end of 2018.  So this will be an interesting year for sure.
