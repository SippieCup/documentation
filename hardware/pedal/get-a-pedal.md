# Get a Pedal

Getting a Comma Pedal is NOT EASY, nor should it be. It’s not exactly a polished and warranted product and it can be dangerous or even deadly to alter the way your car was manufactured. In fact, it doesn’t really even work… that is, unless you build it, flash firmware, and wire it inline with your car’s Accelerator pedal (of which has to be already fitted with some sort of ACC modules) and ensure [OpenPilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) code exists to run it.
