# 2018 Cadillac CT6

The 2018 Cadillac CT6 was upstreamed to the [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) repository and generally means it is a compatible / supported vehicle for openpilot.

We recommend you connect to the [Comma Slack](https://slack.comma.ai) and double check to see how well it is supported for your liking.

## Compatibility

### Longitudinal Control

Openpilot doesn't currently have longitudinal control (acceleration and braking) over the 2018 CT6.
The community appears to be working on a solution to longitudinal control.

### Lateral Control

Openpilot has full lateral control (steering) over the 2018 CT6.

## EON Mounting

We do not have a recommended mount yet, we will update when we find that.

## Recommended Hardware

If you're confident your vehicle matches the specifications above, these are some things you may need to get started.

* 1 x [EON](/hardware/eon/)
* 1 x [Panda](/hardware/panda/)
* 1 x [Giraffe](/hardware/giraffe/)

## Comma Pedal

This vehicle has not been tested with Comma Pedal as of yet but it could possibly benefit from having one.
