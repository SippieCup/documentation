# 2018 Honda Clarity

The 2018 Honda Clarity is currently in early development and may not be fully supported just yet.
It is not currently available in the official [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) version of openpilot just yet.

We will continue to update this page as things progress.

## Compatibility

### Longitudinal Control

Openpilot has longitudinal control (acceleration and braking) over the 2018 Clarity.

### Lateral Control

Openpilot doesn't currently have lateral control (steering) over the 2018 Clarity.
The community appears to be working on a solution to lateral control.

## EON Mounting

We do not have a recommended mount yet, we will update when we find that.

## Recommended Hardware

If you're confident your vehicle matches the specifications above, these are some things you may need to get started.

* 1 x [EON](/hardware/eon/)
* 1 x [Panda](/hardware/panda/)
* 1 x [Giraffe](/hardware/giraffe/)

## Comma Pedal

This vehicle has not been tested with Comma Pedal as of yet but it could possibly benefit from having one.


## Videos

We have not currently found any videos of the Honda Clarity running openpilot.
