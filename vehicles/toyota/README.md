# Toyota

Openpilot is compatible with *some* **Toyota** model(s) so feel free to browse the support pages for these models below for additional specifics.
The goal is to always support as many vehicles as possible.

To chat about Toyota's with the community, checkout the # channel in the [Comma Slack](https://slack.comma.ai).

## Compatible Models

This is the current list of models being tested and/or actively supported by either community members or Comma.ai.  Varying levels of support / testing are being done on the listed models so please review them thoroughly.

* [C-HR](/vehicles/toyota/c-hr.html)
* [Camry](/vehicles/toyota/camry.html)
* [Corolla](/vehicles/toyota/corolla.html)
* [Prius](/vehicles/toyota/prius.html)
* [RAV4](/vehicles/toyota/rav4.html)

## How to add support for a vehicle

If you own an unsupported vehicle but are interested in discussing porting it to openpilot, join us in the *NEW* [openpilot community chat support system](https://spectrum.chat/openpilot) and the always popular [Comma.ai Slack](https://slack.comma.ai/) if you prefer it.

There will also be some great info on porting models in [Development Guides](../../development/guides/).
