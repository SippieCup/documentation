# 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid


## Compatibility

### Longitudinal Control

Openpilot has partial longitudinal control (acceleration and braking) over the 2018 Accord Hybrid.
Due to ECU limitations, this model can only partially be controlled by Openpilot.

Instead of sending actual acceleration / deceleration commands directly to the CAN, Openpilot will only be able to send factory ACC control messages. 

But is still perfectly sufficient for usage.

### Lateral Control

Openpilot has full lateral control (steering) over the 2018 Accord Hybrid.
