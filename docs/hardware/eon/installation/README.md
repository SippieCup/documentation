# Installation

Installing the EON is easy and is as simple as pealing some 3M tape backing off and finding the best spot for it on your windshield.  The EON slides in and out of the mount cleanly and snuggly.

EON's shipping today have a mount already attached in the correct position.  There are two positions for it on both sides of the device but you shouldn't need the other side.  In fact, they may stop shipping the with the flipping option.

It should look similar to the following image.
