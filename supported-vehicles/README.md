# Supported Vehicles

## How do I add support for a vehicle?

If your car has adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist, you are in luck. Using a [panda](https://comma.ai/shop/products/panda-obd-ii-dongle/) and [cabana](https://community.comma.ai/cabana/), you can understand how to make your car drive by wire.

Comma.ai, Inc. wrote a [porting guide](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models-e5467f4b5fe6) for Toyota that might help you after you have the basics figured out.

Sadly, BMW, Audi, Volvo, and Mercedes all use [FlexRay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlexRay) and are unlikely to be supported any time soon. We also put time into a Ford port, but the steering has a 10 second cutout limitation that makes it unusable.
