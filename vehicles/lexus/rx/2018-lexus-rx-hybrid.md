# 2018 Lexus RX Hybrid

The 2018 Lexus RX Hybrid was upstreamed to the [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) repository and generally means it is a compatible / supported vehicle for openpilot.

We recommend you connect to the [Comma Slack](https://slack.comma.ai) and double check to see how well it is supported for your liking.
