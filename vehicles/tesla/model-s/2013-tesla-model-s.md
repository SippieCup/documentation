# 2013 Tesla Model S w/ ACC/LKAS

The 2013 Tesla Model S is currently in active testing within the community 
and a pull request has been made for it to be merged into the official [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) repository.

Although a pull request has been made, this does not mean it will be officially supported or upstreamed to the primary code base.
It might become community supported long-term.

## Compatibility

### Longitudinal Control

Openpilot doesn't currently have longitudinal control (acceleration and braking) over the 2013 Model S.
The community appears to be working on a solution to longitudinal control.

### Lateral Control

Openpilot has full lateral control (steering) over the 2013 Model S.

## EON Mounting

We do not have a recommended mount yet, we will update when we find that.

## Recommended Hardware

If you're confident your vehicle matches the specifications above, these are some things you may need to get started.

* 1 x [EON](/hardware/eon/)
* 1 x [Panda](/hardware/panda/)

## Comma Pedal

This vehicle has not been tested with Comma Pedal as of yet but it could possibly benefit from having one.
