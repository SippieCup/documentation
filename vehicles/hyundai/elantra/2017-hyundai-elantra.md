# 2017 Hyundai Elantra w/ ACC/LKAS

The 2017 Hyundai Elantra is currently in early development and may not be fully supported just yet.
It is not currently available in the official [commaai/openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) version of openpilot just yet.

We will continue to update this page as things progress.

## Compatibility

### Longitudinal Control

Openpilot has partial longitudinal control (acceleration and braking) over the 2017 Elantra Limited Ultimate.
Due to ECU limitations, this model can only partially be controlled by Openpilot.

Instead of sending actual acceleration / deceleration commands directly to the CAN, Openpilot will only be able to send factory ACC control messages. 

But is still perfectly sufficient for usage.

### Lateral Control

Openpilot has full lateral control (steering) over the 2017 Elantra Limited Ultimate.

## EON Mounting

We do not have a recommended mount yet, we will update when we find that.

## Recommended Hardware

If you're confident your vehicle matches the specifications above, these are some things you may need to get started.

* 1 x [EON](/hardware/eon/)
* 1 x [Panda](/hardware/panda/)
* 1 x [Giraffe](/hardware/giraffe/)

## Comma Pedal

This vehicle has not been tested with Comma Pedal as of yet but it could possibly benefit from having one.


## Videos

We have not currently found any videos of the Hyundai Elantra Limited Ultimate running openpilot.
