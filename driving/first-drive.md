# First Drive with Openpilot

Your first drive after [installing Openpilot](/getting-started/installation.md) is always exciting.
You're dying to know if it'll work and what it will be like.

Sometimes the first drive can be kind of discouraging to newcomers that aren't quite sure what to expect.

The first install of Openpilot requires calibration for the software to determine how it is [mounted](/hardware/eon/installation/how-to-mount.md) and what kinds of offsets it has to account for.

This can take anywhere from 10 seconds ([in future versions](/development/releases.md) of Openpilot) all the way up to 30 minutes or so.
