### Custom Giraffe Required

{{ page.title }} requires a custom Giraffe made by a community member.

There are 2 variations depending on your vehicles manufacture date.

Vehicles manufactured on or after May 31, 2013, you may have the newer ODB connector.

Check if the OBD connector in your driver-side footwell has metal contacts for pins 1 and 9.  If it does, your Tesla has the newer-style.

You will also need a custom wiring harness.

Contact @appleguru in the #tesla channel on the comma slack to arrange purchase.
